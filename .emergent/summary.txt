    - A WhatsApp contact button linked to .
- **Footer:** A complete footer with the logo, navigation, and contact information.
- **Tech Stack:** The user explicitly requested to migrate the entire project from a React (CRA) + FastAPI stack to a modern, monolithic **Next.js 16 (App Router) application using TypeScript and Server Actions** to handle form submissions, thereby eliminating the separate backend and database for simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and improved SEO.

**User's preferred language**: Spanish

**what currently exists?**
The agent successfully built the complete landing page using a React (CRA) frontend and a FastAPI backend. However, following a user request, the agent started a major migration to a monolithic Next.js 16 + TypeScript application. A new project has been set up in , with the basic structure, dependencies, and some initial components and server actions created. The original React+FastAPI application still exists but is slated for replacement.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The agent was actively migrating the project from a React/FastAPI stack to a Next.js 16 application with TypeScript. The process involved setting up the new project structure in , installing dependencies (, , ,  components, ), copying static assets (logos), and creating foundational files. This includes , , , a server action for the contact form (), validation schemas, and several UI components in TypeScript ().
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent. After the migration is complete, the agent needs to run the Next.js application and use the screenshot tool to verify the UI and functionality.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Complete the migration to Next.js 16 + TypeScript** (Priority: P0)
  - **Where to resume:** Continue building out the new application inside the  directory.
    1.  Fully implement the main page at  by migrating all sections (Header, Hero, Tech Stack, Success Cases, Contact Form, Footer) from the original , converting them to TypeScript and using the new component structure.
    2.  The  component was created in a simplified form. It needs to be fully populated with all 26 technologies, categories, and logos, as it was in the original .
    3.  Ensure the Server Action at  is correctly wired to the new contact form and uses the user's Gmail credentials from environment variables.
    4.  Verify all functionalities, including the theme toggle and form submission, are working in the new Next.js app.
  - **What will be achieved with this?** A single, simplified, SEO-friendly Next.js application that meets all user requirements, eliminating the Python backend and MongoDB.
  - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend. The backend will become obsolete.
  - **Blocked on something:** None.

- **Task 2: Finalize the migration and clean up the project** (Priority: P1)
  - **Where to resume:** After the new Next.js application has been fully developed and verified.
    1.  Delete the old React application directory: .
    2.  Delete the old FastAPI backend directory: .
    3.  Rename the new application directory to take its place: .
  - **What will be achieved with this?** The project directory will be cleaned, leaving only the final Next.js codebase.
  - **Status:** NOT STARTED
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend (a final check after the rename).
  - **Blocked on something:** Task 1.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- None. All requirements have been consolidated into the ongoing migration task.

**Completed work in this session**
- A complete, production-ready landing page was built on a React (CRA) + FastAPI stack, fulfilling all initial user requirements for design, content, and functionality.
- **Key features implemented (in the old stack):**
    - Custom Logo Design and Integration ()
    - Dynamic Theme Toggle (Light/Dark mode) ()
    - Categorized Technology Showcase with 26 custom logos ()
    - Client Success Cases section.
    - Backend email notification system for the contact form via Gmail SMTP (, ).
- Initiated a full-stack migration to a Next.js 16 + TypeScript architecture based on user's request for better SEO and a simpler stack.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- None. All previously identified issues were resolved before the migration decision.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Previous Stack:** React (CRA), FastAPI, MongoDB, JavaScript
- **New Stack (Migration Target):** Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript, Server Actions, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui

**key DB schema**
- The MongoDB schema is now **obsolete**. The new architecture is database-less.

**changes in tech stack**
- A fundamental architectural shift from a multi-repository (React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB) stack to a monolithic, serverless-first Next.js 16 application. This eliminates Python and MongoDB from the stack entirely.

**All files of reference**
- : **Crucial reference** for UI, content, and component logic that needs to be migrated to .
- : The directory where all new development is happening.
- : The file containing the server-side logic to replace the old FastAPI email endpoint.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Your primary and only goal is to complete the migration.** All work must be done inside the  directory. Do not modify the old  or  folders.
- The objective is to replicate the existing design and functionality **exactly** but within the new Next.js and TypeScript framework. Use  as the visual and functional blueprint.
- The FastAPI backend and MongoDB are being **completely removed**. The contact form will be handled by a Next.js Server Action using Nodemailer.
- Use the user's provided Gmail credentials for the email service. They must be configured as environment variables for the Next.js application (e.g., in a  file).

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken:** The project is in a planned transitional state. The final Next.js application is under construction in  and is not yet functional.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- **Nodemailer:** To be used within a Next.js Server Action for sending contact form emails via the user's Gmail SMTP. Requires User API Key (app password).

**Testing status**
- No testing has been performed on the new Next.js application.

**Credentials to test flow:**
- **Gmail Credentials for Nodemailer:**
  - : 
  - : 
- **Recipient Email:** 

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent was in the middle of the migration when the session ended. The most critical pieces not yet completed are:
    1.  The full construction of the main page component () with all its sections.
    2.  The complete implementation of the  component with all 26 logos and categories.</analysis>
